4chan client for iOS

Hi! If you're reading this it means you came here after I finally made this repo public (for resume purposes mostly)

# FAQ

## What is Channers?

Well beyond being a client for one of the sites on the internet ever. It's the first Swift project I ever made! 

I picked 4chan because it had an incredibly straightforward API and layout which meant prototyping a workable app was easy (I didn't want to go for a big site that would be hard and I might give up before making something)

## Is the app done?

No, but it's buildable

## Will you ever update/finish it?

Probably not, might release updates to make it more workable in its current form but no "big" things
